# Jellyfin API

Verified against Jellyfin **10.11** (the public demo server) — the client uses
the user-scoped legacy routes (`Users/{id}/…`), which every server from 10.8
onward still answers, rather than the newer `/UserViews`-style routes.

## Wire format

- JSON keys are **PascalCase** both ways. `JellyfinClient` installs global
  key strategies (lowercase-first-letter on decode, uppercase-first-letter on
  encode) so model types stay camelCase with no per-field CodingKeys.
- No `Date` fields are decoded anywhere. Jellyfin emits .NET 7-digit
  fractional-second timestamps that `ISO8601DateFormatter` rejects; the UI
  only needs `ProductionYear`, so dates are simply not modeled.
- Positions and durations are .NET **ticks** (100 ns; 1 s = 10 000 000).
  Convert only through the `Ticks` helpers.
- Decoding is defensive: `decodeIfPresent` + defaults, unknown item types
  collapse to `.other`, unexpected shapes in optional relations (`userData`,
  `mediaSources`) degrade to nil instead of failing the whole list.

## Auth

Every request carries:

```
Authorization: MediaBrowser Client="Lagoon", Device="Apple TV",
               DeviceId="<keychain uuid>", Version="<app version>"[, Token="…"]
```

- `POST Users/AuthenticateByName` `{Username, Pw}` → `AccessToken` + `User`.
- **Quick Connect**: `GET QuickConnect/Enabled` → if true, `POST
  QuickConnect/Initiate` (needs the MediaBrowser header, no token) returns
  `{Code, Secret}`; poll `GET QuickConnect/Connect?secret=` every 2 s until
  `Authenticated`, then `POST Users/AuthenticateWithQuickConnect {Secret}`.
  Expiry surfaces as an error on the poll — reset the UI, don't retry the
  same secret.
- `POST Sessions/Logout` on sign-out invalidates the token server-side.
- Pre-auth server validation hits `GET System/Info/Public` (no header
  needed); its `ServerName` seeds the sign-in screen.

## Library endpoints

| Purpose | Endpoint | Quirk |
|---|---|---|
| Libraries | `Users/{uid}/Views` | filter `CollectionType` to `movies`/`tvshows` |
| Browse/search | `Users/{uid}/Items` | `ParentId`, `IncludeItemTypes`, `SearchTerm`, paged via `StartIndex`/`Limit` |
| Item detail | `Users/{uid}/Items/{id}` | re-fetched after playback for fresh `UserData` |
| Continue watching | `Users/{uid}/Items/Resume` | `MediaTypes=Video` |
| Next up | `Shows/NextUp?UserId=` | |
| Recently added | `Users/{uid}/Items/Latest` | **returns a bare array**, not an `Items` wrapper |
| Seasons/episodes | `Shows/{seriesId}/Seasons` / `…/Episodes?SeasonId=` | |

List calls pass `Fields=Overview,Genres,…` (`JellyfinClient.defaultFields`)
because the server omits those from list payloads by default.

## Images

`imageURL(for:kind:maxWidth:)` builds `Items/{id}/Images/{type}` URLs with the
item's image **tag** (cache-buster) and falls back through parent artwork the
way official clients do: episode primary → series poster
(`SeriesPrimaryImageTag`), own backdrop → `ParentBackdropItemId`'s backdrop.
`kind: .thumb` prefers episode stills (their Primary slot), then `Thumb`,
then backdrops.

## App Transport Security

`LagoonInfo.plist` sets `NSAllowsArbitraryLoads` because home-LAN Jellyfin
servers are commonly plain http on `:8096`. The trade-off is deliberate and
matches Infuse/Swiftfin behavior; revisit if the app ever ships to the App
Store (scope to `NSAllowsLocalNetworking` + declared domains instead).

## Testing without a home server

The public demo (`https://demo.jellyfin.org/stable`, user `demo`, empty
password) exercises the full flow including Quick Connect discovery and
playback, and is what the MVP was verified against end-to-end.
